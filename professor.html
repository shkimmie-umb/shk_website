							<h2>Data Analysis on Factors Determining Professors' Salary</h2>
							<h4>Tools:<br>
								Data processing - JS, Pandas in Colab<br>
								Visualization - Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Holoview</h4>
							
						</header>
						
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>We have vast amounts of faculty salary data linked to RateMyProfessor, but it is difficult to get insights at a glance.
							For example, even if you are curious about the distribution of salaries by department or position, 
							it is very difficult to grasp related information only with data listed in numbers.
							From now on, we intend to visualize the trend of annual salary information by category and convert it
							into meaningful data that can be understood at a glance.

							Specifically, the following is a summary of what we are curious about.
							<ol>
								<li>Is there a correlation between professor ratings and salary?</li>
								<li>Is there a correlation between the salary according to the position of the professor?</li>
								<li>Is there a difference in annual salary depending on the department within the same school?</li>
							  </ol>

						<h2>Data Exploration</h2>

						<p>The original data contains a lot of data that we won't use. 
						Let's preprocess the data to make it easier to see.</p>

						<iframe src="./graphs/default_data_simplified.html" width="800" height="310" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>Now, only data related to the curiosity we are trying to solve remains. With this data, let's visualize the salary correlation.</p>

						<p>1. Is there a correlation between professor ratings and salary?</p>
						<p>We tried to express the annual salary by simplifying the rating from 0 to 5 into a total of six.
							Since the RateMyProfessor rating comes out to 1 decimal place, it was floored to the nearest rating and we visualized the annual salary.
							As a result, although the annual salary does not differ very significantly depending on the rating, it seemed to have some correlation.</p>

						<p>If so, will the position of the professor have a greater influence on contributing to the salary?
							To find the answer to this question, we visualized the annual salary of professors in the Department of Computer Science according to their positions.</p>

						<p>2. Is there a correlation between the salary according to the position of the professor?</p>
						
						<iframe src="./graphs/positionvssalary.html" width="700" height="300" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>It was confirmed that the difference in annual salary according to the professor's 
							position was noticeably evident compared to the annual salary graph compared to the 
							professor's ratings.</p>

						<p>From now on, we will visualize whether there is a difference in the salary of a professor depending on the department.</p>

						<p>3. Is there a difference in annual salary depending on the department within the same school?</p>

						<iframe src="./graphs/departmentvssalary.html" width="700" height="300" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>It was confirmed that there was also a difference in the annual salary of professors depending on 
							the department. There was a clear difference between STEM departments and non-STEM departments. 
							Currently, the graph is containing mainly STEM departments, so a lot of non-STEM is missing, 
							but if non-STEM departments are added, the trend of annual salary changes is expected to be more prominent.</p>

						<br></br>
						<p>However, the graphs we have made so far only show the average value, and the distribution is unknown.
							Therefore, let's visualize the distribution by each category using a box graph.</p>
						
						<iframe src="./graphs/departmentvssalarybox.html" width="700" height="350" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>The average annual salary by department was not significantly different, but as you can see now, 
							the difference in the distribution of the maximum minimum annual salary by department was confirmed, 
							and the Computer Science department, which was not confirmed in the previous graph, 
							showed the largest distribution difference.</p>

						<iframe src="./graphs/positionvssalarybox.html" width="700" height="350" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>Salary distribution by position is clearer. Not only is there a clear difference in average annual salary by position, 
							but the distribution of annual salary by position can better understand the trend of annual salary by 
							position.</p>

						<iframe src="./graphs/ratingvssalarybox.html" width="700" height="350" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

						<p>Interestingly, salary versus professor's grade showed a correlation, but a high salary 
							was not always guaranteed. We found that professor's grade did not have a significant effect 
							on annual salary.</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>

						<p>We did a visualization analysis of the faculty's grade, position, and 
							affiliated department's teaching salary. As a result, it was confirmed that 
							there was a significant difference between the position and the affiliated 
							department, and that the professor's grade was also slightly affected. 
							Through the process of discovering meaningful facts from such a vast amount 
							of data, I realized the importance of data analysis through visualization. 
							As for the next project plan, we will deal with more aesthetic graphs and data 
							analysis in more diverse fields.</p>
